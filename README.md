# battleShip
Program built with the P5.JS library at *All Star Code*

Library used:

## Purpose
---
The purpose of this project was to experiment with P5's functionalities in order to better understand the library.

### Result

The program is a replication of a battleship. It creates a random assortment of battleships (squares) and covers them up with a grid layer. When the user clicks on a square the program will determine whether or not they hit a battleship.
